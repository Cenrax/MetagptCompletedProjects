## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'utils.py' module contains utility functions that can be used across the project.

The 'player.py' module defines the Player class, which represents a player in the game.

The 'board.py' module defines the Board class, which represents the game board.

The 'ai.py' module defines the AI class, which represents the AI opponent in single-player mode.

The 'game.py' module defines the Game class, which manages the game logic.

The 'main.py' module is the entry point of the program.
